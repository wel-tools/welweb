## What is WelWeb?

WelWeb aims to deliver a unified, seamless development experience influenced by Ethereum's [Web3](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/) implementation. We have taken the core ideas and expanded upon it to unlock the functionality of WELUPS's unique feature set along with offering new tools for integrating DApps in the browser, Node.js and IoT devices.

## Compatibility
- Version built for Node.js v6 and above
- Version built for browsers with more than 0.25% market share

You can access either version specifically from the dist folder.

WelWeb is also compatible with frontend frameworks such as:
- Angular
- React
- Vue.

You can also ship WelWeb in a Chrome extension.

## Installation

### Node.js
```bash
npm install welweb
```
or
```bash
yarn add welweb
```
